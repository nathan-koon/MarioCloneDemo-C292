        // and -1 meaning you're pressing the negative button.
        // So if we're pressing 'd' on the keyboard, moveInput will be: 1

        // Translate() needs a vector to be passed in as an argument.

        // and moves it in the direction and distance specified by the vector.
        // If you don't know what a vector is, it's a unit that defines direction and magnitude.
        // So in 2D space, we have the x and y axis.
        // So, (x, y) is the format of the vector.
        // (1, 0) would be saying, "move 1 unit on the positive x axis", which is to the right.

        // (0, 1) is telling it to move 1 unit on the positive y axis, which is upwards.
        // (0, -1) is the same, but downwards.
        // (1, 1) means move 1 unit right, and one unit upward.
        // So basically if you measured from the horizontal axis, it's 45 degrees up and to the right.

        // In the line above, Vector2.right is simply shorthand for: new Vector2(1, 0).
        // So let's say our current input is the 'd' key, that means moveInput = 1.
        // Let's say our moveSpeed = 5 and Time.deltaTime = 0.0167 (this is the time between each frame when running at 60 fps).
        // So our equation is 1 * (1, 0) * 5 * 0.0167 = (0.0835, 0).
        // So our player will move 0.0835 meters to the right every frame.

        // This particular version takes a vector, and the ForceMode2D of the physics force, which is just an enum defined in the Rigidbody2D class.
        // So again, Vector2.up = new Vector2(0, 1).
        // So we're multiplying that vector by the jumpForce which doesn't change the direction of the jump, but it does change the magnitude.
        // And ForceMode.Impulse means we want 100% of the force applied instantly in a single frame.
